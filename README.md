## (2pt) Briefly Answer this question: What are the pros and cons of TDD?
### Pros
- The Test-Driven Development (TDD) combines building and testing, which helps the correctness of the code.
- It indirectly evolve the architecture and design to helps them to be good.
- It makes the code unit testable by modularize them. The TDD developement also helps the architectural problems to be easy to solve.
- It helps the code documentatation to makes the code easier to understand.
- Makes the code easier to maintain and refactor because it provides a a level of clarity in the development stage.
- Make the team work and collaboration easirer and efficeient as TDD improves the readibility of the code.
- From certain point of speaking, it prevents the defects.
- It encourage the programmer to test their code steps by steps, whcih utimaltely helps programmer debug.
### Cons
- It's time consuming since the test suite itself need to be maintained.
- Some of the test might be hard to write, and some features and functionality beyonds ther unit testing scope.
- It slows down the developement speed.
- It might lead the team put to much effort on creat a perfect test suite.
- It might lead the team to put to much focus on passing the test, even though some tests rarely happen in reality. It stagnated the development.
- It needs more members to focus on test, which is high cost for some start-ups.
- Modification on the architecture and design of the product requires the team to change the test suite as well.
- It's hard for some teammate to shift their way of working into TDD, especially when they have a stereotype way of working.
